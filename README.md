# Money-Laundring-Analysis-Project-BigData-Analytics-GCP-Hadoop-PySpark
In the fight against financial fraud, predicting fraudulent transactions within massive datasets is crucial. Our project aims to leverage advanced analytics and big data techniques to identify patterns of money laundering within a comprehensive synthetic financial transaction dataset provided by IBM. Below are our objectives:

Analyze synthetic transaction data and identify patterns indicative of fraud.
Investigate correlations between transaction features such as amount, currency, and payment format that are most frequently associated with detecting potential money laundering
Analyze temporal patterns, including transaction volume spikes, to identify potential instances of money laundering activities over time.
The proliferation of financial crimes, including money laundering, poses significant threats to both financial institutions and society at large. Financial fraud not only results in substantial economic losses but also undermines the integrity of financial systems and erodes public trust. As criminals continuously adapt their tactics to exploit vulnerabilities in traditional detection methods, there is an urgent need for innovative approaches to combat these illicit activities.
